## Pain Points and Suggested Improvements

Talking about the unit conversion project repo, the whole project had a set of instructions that could quickly be followed. However, if a developer looks at it, he/she would question if it actually contains everything one would need to get it running in 2023. Issues faced here could be summarised under these brackets, i.e., lack of familiarity, documentation gaps, legacy code issues, technical debt, integrations, dependencies, and evolving requirements. When we inherit a project developed by someone else, we may not be familiar with the codebase and coding style and this makes it challenging to quickly understand and work with existing code.   

To start off with, the project does not mention that it is a Chrome extension and by looking at the name, one would not actually know that it is an extension. On further inspection, it can be inferred that it is a browser extension but it falls short in mentioning that it is supported only by ‘Google Chrome’. Modern-day developers use a vast array of different browsers and support for each one of them would have been appreciated. The project forces the user to work on Google Chrome. The documentation gap seems apparent since it does not clearly mention that they require Google Chrome. 
Integrations and dependencies include having npm and NodeJs installed. The version number is missing here and this plays a huge role in getting the project up and running. Different NodeJs versions support different libraries and not everything would function smoothly on newer versions. A common error that crept up was "Uncaught ReferenceError: module is not defined" and this typically occurs in JavaScript when you are trying to use the module object, which is part of the CommonJS or ES6 module system, in an environment that doesn't support it. We need to ensure here that we are working in the correct module system and also need to correctly identify the browser environment we are working in. Since the project was developed in 2020, the developers have not provided sufficient support for evolving environments and updates. 

The errors that crept up required us to correct existing code and although the codebase was modular, each function lacked the required documentation to make necessary changes. The auto-generated Jdocs were insufficient to interpret. Overall, the project could be run but due to the errors in code, not all features were working as expected.
